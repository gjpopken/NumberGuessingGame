Certainly, Gavin! Here's another JavaScript challenge that focuses on creating a simple interactive game. 

### **Coding Challenge: Number Guessing Game**

**Task:** Create a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the correct number. The game should provide hints to the player about whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

**Requirements:**

1. **HTML Structure:** Create an input field for the player to enter their guess, a button to submit the guess, and an area to display feedback messages (e.g., "Too high!", "Too low!", or "Correct!").

2. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - Generate a random number between 1 and 100 as the target number.
   - Allow the player to input a number guess.
   - Provide feedback messages based on the player's guess compared to the target number (e.g., "Too high!", "Too low!", or "Correct!").
   - Keep track of the number of attempts the player has made.
   - When the player guesses the correct number, display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts.

3. **CSS Styling:**
   - Style the game to make it visually appealing. You can use CSS to format the input field, button, feedback messages, and overall layout.

**Optional Enhancements:**

1. **Difficulty Levels:** Allow the player to select a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) that determines the range of the random number (e.g., easy: 1-50, medium: 1-100, hard: 1-1000).

2. **Timer:** Add a timer to the game to see how quickly the player can guess the correct number.

3. **High Score:** Keep track of the player's best score (fewest attempts) and display it after each game.

4. **Animations:** Add animations or visual effects to enhance the user experience (e.g., colorful feedback messages, fading effects).

This challenge provides an opportunity to practice handling user input, generating random numbers, conditional statements, and updating the DOM based on user actions. You can start with the basic version of the game and then add more features to enhance its functionality and user experience.

Feel free to get creative with the design and interactions to make the game engaging for players. If you have any questions or need assistance with specific aspects of this challenge, feel free to ask!
